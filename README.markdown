# Fiscal Notes

Fiscal notes are cost estimates of pending bills  in state legislatures.  For some legislators, they can be a critical component of whether the bill should be adopted.  In Kentucky, fiscal notes are prepared by the Legislative Research Commission (LRC), whereas they are prepared by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) at the federal level.  An extensive [analysis](fiscal_note/resources/2015-11-24_cbpp_better_cost_estimates.pdf) of fiscal notes was undertaken by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) where they identified six criteria as "best practices."

States that were identified as having best practices do the following:
1. Prepare fiscal notes for substantially all proposals (38 states + D.C.);
2. Free estimates from partisan pressure (33 states + D.C.);
3. Project long term impact (12 states + D.C.);
4. Revise estimates as needed (27 states + D.C.); and
5. Post fiscal notes online (46 states + D.C.).

The goal of this writeup is identify whether Kentucky follows these best practices and whether they could be adopted to improve its long term financial sustainability.

## Terminology

Kentucky law includes multiple terms when describing the economic impact of legislative and agency actions.  The most common term is "fiscal note", but there are others used as well like "cost analysis", "cost estimate", "fiscal impact statement", and "economic impact statement". The terms are not interchangeable and can have very specific meanings.  Below is a list of the different analyses undertaken to determine an initiative's economic impact to the Commonwealth of Kentucky

- "Fiscal Statements".   Pursuant to House and Senate Rules, the LRC staff prepare fiscal statements that describe the financial implications of particular bills if such legislation were to be enacted. Fiscal statements consist of certain components that are prepared as necessary depending upon the subject matter and scope of the legislation. The components of fiscal statements are described below.

- "Fiscal Notes" describe how legislation affects the revenues or expenditures of state government generally. Fiscal notes are prepared upon (1) the request of the sponsor of a bill, (2) the request of the chair of the standing committee to which the bill is referred, or (3) the request of that committee by vote. Fiscal Notes are requested through the Office of Budget Review.

- "Local Mandate Statements" describe how legislation fiscally affects local governments through imposition of a local mandate. Local mandates are state laws that assign new responsibilities to local governments.  LRC staff **automatically** prepare local mandate statements when drafting bills containing such mandates.

- "Actuarial Analysis Statements" describe how legislation changes the financial liability of any public retirement system administered by an agency of state government. LRC staff **automatically** cause actuarial analysis statements to be prepared by the public retirement systems when drafting bills pertaining to this subject matter.

- "Corrections Impact Statements" describe how legislation fiscally affects state or local corrections services in a significant manner. LRC staff **automatically** cause corrections impact statements to be prepared by the Justice Cabinet when drafting bills pertaining to this subject matter.

- "Health Benefit Analyses" describe whether legislation contains a mandated health benefit for purposes of health insurance coverage and the estimated financial effect of the addition of the benefit within health insurance coverage. LRC staff identify legislation for potential health benefit analysis by the Department of Insurance.

## Fiscal Notes in Kentucky Legislature

### Statutes

KRS 6.950 defines a "fiscal note" as a realistic statement of the estimated effect on expenditures or revenue of local government in implementing" an Act of the General Assembly.

KRS 6.955 requires a fiscal note to be prepared and attached to any bill "which relates to any aspect of local government or any service provided thereby . . . ."  However, the requirement may be waived if 2/3 of the members elected to vote waive its requirement.  A certification by the clerk must be attached to the bill.  If waived in one chamber--either the House or the Senate, the second chamber may waive the fiscal note by a simple majority vote.  Additionally, any executive order by the Governor that relates **any aspect** of local government or **any service** shall not be issued unless a fiscal note has been prepared.

KRS 6.965 gives the director of the Legislative Research Commission the discretion to decide whether a bill or executive order is a state mandate and permits the director to seek a finding from the Attorney General on the issue.  Any bill that is amended requires that fiscal note be updated to account for the change.

### Kentucky House Rules

[Kentucky House Rule 52](statutes/2019-01-08_house_rules_pages_32_33.pdf) gives the details on when a fiscal note or statement is required. The sponsor of a bill may request LRC to prepare a "fiscal statement". But the LRC is required to prepare one if a bill would fiscally affect (1) local governments, (2) any public retirement system, or (3) state or local corrections service. "The chair of the committee to which a bill has been referred may require that a fiscal statement be attached to the bill prior to posting. The chair or a majority of the committee to which a bill has been referred may require that a fiscal statement be attached to the bill, or amendment thereof, prior to final committee action."

Finally, "[m]embers may require, by majority vote, that a fiscal statement be attached to any bill or amendment on the Orders of the Day relating to fiscal matters herein described. In that instance, the fiscal statement shall be attached to the bill, or amendment thereof, prior to final consideration of the bill on the floor of the House."

[Kentucky House Rule 53](statutes/2019-01-08_house_rules_pages_32_33.pdf) states that "any member proposing an **amendment** which relates to fiscal matters described in Rule 52 may cause a fiscal statement to be prepared. A fiscal statement shall be considered a public document upon introduction of the bill or amendment for which it was prepared."

### Kentucky Senate Rules

## Fiscal Notes in Kentucky Agencies

Fiscal notes are also required upon the promulgation of an administrative regulation and must consider the cost to state and local government.  [KRS 13A.250](statutes/1984-04-13_krs_013A_250.pdf).  The proposed regulation must be accompanied by a "fiscal note."  The statute specifically identifies items that must be included:  (1) the number of the administrative regulation, (2) contact information, (3) the government subdivisions affected, (4) the service to which the regulation relates along with the legal authority  that mandates the service, (5) estimated fiscal impact for the **first full year**.  "If specific dollar estimates cannot be determined, the administrative body shall provide a brief narrative of the fiscal impact."

## Plot of Fiscal Note Best Practices to Fiscal Condition

The table above was constructed from a publication authored by the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org) ("CBPP"). The organization published a [guide](resources/2015-11-24_cbpp_better_cost_estimates_table_2.pdf) entitled, "Better Cost Estimates, Better Budgets:  Improved Fiscal Notes Would Help States Make More Informed Decisions." The author listed five best practices in the use of fiscal notes:
1. Prepare fiscal notes for all proposals;
2. Free estimates from partisan pressure;
3. Project long term impact;
4. Revise estimates as needed; and
5. Post fiscal notes online.

To than end, the CBPP prepared a table as to what states used these practices in drafting a fiscal note. Those states that were using one or more of the above practices were then added up and assigned the variable "total."  The CBPP's table was then combined with data from the [Mercatus Center](https://www.mercatus.org).

## Sample states

### Utah

Utah is ranked high for financial performance and follows 5 out of 6 best practices.  There, the "Office of the Legislative Fiscal Analyst" was created within the legislature.  According to Utah [statute](statutes/2018-05-08_utah_36_12_12.pdf), the fiscal analyst is to prepare "fiscal estimates" on **all** bills that reflect:

1. potential state government revenue impacts;
2. anticipated state government expenditure changes;
3. anticipated expenditure changes for local governments;
4. anticipated direct expenditure changes for state residents and businesses;
5. whether proposed bill will increase/decrease the regulatory burden;
6. whether the regulator impact will be high, medium or low.

In carrying out the analysis set forth above, the fiscal analyst is given subpoena powers.

### Maryland

Maryland follows 6 of 6 best practices.  The Maryland [statute](statutes/2009-01-01_maryland_2_1505.pdf) does not allow for a committee to vote on a bill unless it is accompanied with a fiscal note, and if the bill affects the state pension system, it must be accompanied with an actuarial analysis.  The Executive Director is required to prepare a fiscal note for each bill. A fiscal note shall contain "an estimate of the fiscal impact of the bill on the revenues and expenditures of the State government and of local governments" for the year it becomes effective and the four years after that.  The fiscal note is to clearly identify if the bill is a local mandate and an estimate of the impact.  Sources used in the drafting of the fiscal note must be disclosed. A bill may be introduced without a fiscal note, and the fact that a bill failed to have a fiscal note cannot be used to attack the underlying statute's validity.

### Texas

Texas follows 6 of 6 of the best practices.  Its [statute](statutes/2009-01-01_texas_314_001_005.pdf) requires that five-year estimates be prepared.  The fiscal note is  "required on a bill or resolution" and "it must be attached  to the bill or resolution before a committee hearing on the bill or resolution may be conducted."  Texas uses a novel approach to estimating costs called "dynamic scoring".  To assess the accuracy of dynamic scoring, "on the fifth anniversary of the effective date of a bill that becomes law for which a dynamic fiscal impact statement was prepared under this section, the comptroller shall prepare and submit to the presiding officer of each house of the legislature a report that assesses the accuracy of the relevant fiscal note prepared for the bill and the accuracy of the relevant dynamic fiscal impact statement prepared for the bill." A sample fiscal note is included [here](fiscal_note_examples/2015-04-22_texas_sample_fiscal_note.pdf).

### Iowa

Iowa follows 6 of 6 of the best practices; however, its enactment is by Senate and House concurrent [resolution](statutes/2019-01-01_iowa_SCR3.pdf), rather than by statute.  There, a  fiscal note shall be attached to "any bill or joint resolution which reasonably could have an annual effect of at least one hundred thousand dollars or a combined total effect within five years after enactment of five hundred thousand dollars or more on the aggregate revenues, expenditures, or fiscal liability of the state or its subdivisions." A number of jurisdictions have dollar limit that triggers the preparation of a fiscal note.  The rule doesn't apply to the budget.  The projected window is for five years and specify the source of the information.  The fiscal note must state whether an accurate estimate can be made.  Additionally, a fiscal note may be requested if an amendment to the bill is made. A sample Iowa fiscal not is included [here](fiscal_note_examples/2019-02-20_iowa_fiscal_note_example.pdf).

### Oregon

Oregon is perfect in best practices as well, scoring 6 for 6.  Oregon's [statute](statutes/2016-04-01_oregon_173.025.pdf) provides that the "Legislative Fiscal Officer" shall prepare a "fiscal impact statement for each measure reported out of committee . . . that could have an effect on expenditures." The revenue impact statement must include three consecutive biennia, beginning with the current one.  Another statute provides greater detail for bills that create a new crime or change penalties.  A criminal justice bill would require costs to be projected over 10 years. A sample Oregon fiscal note is included [here](fiscal_note/fiscal_note_examples/2019-03-15_oregon_fiscal_note_example.pdf).

# Bill Limits

National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a state-by-state comparison of [bill limits](http://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/limiting-bill-introductions.aspx). According to their website, there are 109,000 bill introductions each year and sessions last an average of 120 days.  The NCSL site says that "the ability to consider a large volume of bills is not necessarily compatible with restricted session time." Kentucky passed a house concurrent resolution 54 in 2000 to study the adoption of bill limits, but efforts to locate a report from the committee were unsucessful.  If Kentucky legislators were limited to three bills in the short session, the number of bills anticipated would be three times the membership of 138 for a total of 414, excluding additional bills for leadership and repealer bills filed by the membership.  For long sessions, the anticipated total would be five times the membership of 138 for a total of 690.
